# Python_Instacart_Analysis
# Objective
This project focused on Instacart, an online grocery store that operates though an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I was tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria they provided.

# Data
I was provided with the following datasets that containted all the customer information:

* Customers
* Departments 
* Orders
* Orders_products_prior
* Products

# Folders
The basket analysis was separated into the following folders:
* Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
* Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively.
  NOTE: This folder has not been included
* Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
* Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
* Sent to client: Contains the Final Report in Excel
