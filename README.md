# Python_Instacart_Analysis
# Objective
This project focused on Instacart, an online grocery store that operates though an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I was tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria they provided.

# Data
I was provided with the following datasets that containted all the customer information:
  Customers
  Departments

  Orders_products_prior
  Products
